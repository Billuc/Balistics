# Balistics

An easy little game where you have to reach a cube from a point by choosing an angle and a speed.
This game allowed me to learn how to trace function, how to dynamically modify the graph and how to interact with buttons.
This was a project I did when I was learning, so I know it is not optimal and it can be ameliorated.
